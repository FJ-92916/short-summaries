<h4>This is where I write when I need a break in class. If you want you can say that it's a blog.</h4>
<p> Hunger for macaroni and cheese and a big dose of frustration ends in this</p>

<p> Ok, so I'm bored and a little frustrated. My image isn't coming up so that's great. I'm not as tired as I was earlier.

<p> Now I have color and it reminds me of the ocean. A pastel ocean. I should get help with my image. It's friday.
I want to take a nap but I'm in school so I can't 
 
<p> Guess who's tired! me! Right now I'd rather be talking to my friends. I don't like mondays because we all have second lunch and that's not fun.
Like It would be so much better to have first lunch for everyone but whatever. I'm bored bored bored. 
<p> I'm back. there's an hour left to this class and I think I can survive. Then I can go to pack period. That's not much better but at 
least I'm with my friends. Mac and cheese sounds really good right now.

<p> so I made a contact sheet but I still don't have pictures. apparently we're going to publish this online. I bet no one will view this page and that's
absoulutely fine. I'm wasteing time with this page but it's something and maybe my "honest  creativity" will earn me a good grade. Not going to lie, I would be on my phone right now but I want to save the battery. A fun thing to do is to go to adobe color and move the colors around really fast and you have a mini light show.
That's another way I waste time. I don't remember if we're on GoGaurdian in this class. If we are, hello! I know my teacher will see this but I don't care
Hey, honesty is the best policy right? This class period has been going by fast. That's a good thing because I want to go see my friends.
Now I'm starting to get a little tired. There should really be naptime at school. If kindergarteners don't want their naptime I will gladly take it

<p> So I think that I'm almost done with this site. Yay me! I figured out how to add pictures and center align so now this looks okay. It's definitly not
the best but I did put effort into this.</p>

<p>I'm back and here's some facts: <ul><li>Mario Kart an awesome game</li> <li>The purple computer and heart at the top of the home page is supposed to be a logo
</li><li>Homecoming was fun</li> <li> I'm tired</li></ul>
I have a new tactic. Work a little then play a round of Mario kart. Then work then play then work then play and so on. Also my website is looking pretty good. The contact sheet works now and thats good.
It feels so weird typing on this computer. The keys are different but they sound satisfying. I learned last week that I can charge my phone from the computer. So that's
cool. I don't know whether I'm supposed to do that but I will until I'm told otherwise. Monday isn't such a bad day. Tuesday is the worst because your stuck
in the week with no early relese or weekend in sight. Wednesday is alright because you know you're almost done and Friday is the best weekday.
<p>I have no brain power today. I'm so tired and need to go back to sleep. I'm also debating whether I should turn this in now or tomorrow.\
I do't know what else to put on my website but I don't feel like turning it in yet. </p>
